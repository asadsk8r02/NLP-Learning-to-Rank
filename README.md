# Natural Langauage Processing - Learning to Rank


* Developed and implemented machine learning algorithms that can automatically rank various types of items, such as documents, web pages, images, or products, in a manner that is both relevant and useful for users on MSLR-WEB10K dataset.
* Used XGBoost and Random forest for feature selection to implement Pointwise, Pairwise and Listwise learning to rank algorithm.
